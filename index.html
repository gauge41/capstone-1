        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
            My current employment is with Protech, a contracting company that provides staff to the Newmont Gold Mine 
            in the Tanami Desert. There, I have been operating trucks within the underground mine.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            With exception to the last 6 months, my career has been entirely in the industry of law-enforcement. 
            Since 2006, I have served within the Northern Territory and South Australian Police Forces. Through 
            this time, I’ve achieved the qualification of Sergeant, undertaken a wide range of tasks that require 
            differing disciplines including Watchhouse duties and prisoner care; both remote and urban.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have travelled all over the Territory and worked in some of the most remote Indigenous communities. 
            My understanding of the people and land has grown over the course of my career and has assisted in my ability 
            to effectively communicate across cultural differences to reach understanding, de-escalate volatile situations 
            and to achieve positive results.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy working in team-based environments and cannot overlook the benefits of different perspectives to a problem, 
            however, can operate effectively as an individual towards an objective or task, depending on operational requirements.
